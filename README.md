Mission
---
The goal of the site is to help:
- Consumers understand green button
- Developers use green button data to make tools and services
- Utilities and other service providers generate energy data using the green button standard

How it works
---
GreenButtonData.org is a static HTML/CSS/JS site. The site's pages are maintained in simple Markdown files, which are compiled into HTML by Jekyll.

The lists of utilities and other companies that appear on the homepage are maintained in easy-to-read YAML files (".yml") in the /_data directory.

GitHub is our CMS for this project. Content editors have GitHub accounts, edit the Markdown and YAML files themselves, and preview the results on http://green-button.github.io. Pushes to the live server are, for now, handled by the development team.

Contributing
---
Content and feature suggestions are welcome via GitHub Issues. Code contributions are welcome via pull request, although of course we cannot guarantee your changes will be included in the site.

Thanks
